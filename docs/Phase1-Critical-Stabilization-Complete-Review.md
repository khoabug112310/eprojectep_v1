## 🚀 Phase 2 Readiness Gate

Phase 1 must be 100% complete before proceeding to Phase 2 (Enhancement & Polish). The stabilization foundation ensures that:

1. **System Reliability**: No critical failures or data corruption
2. **Security Compliance**: Production-ready security measures
3. **Performance Baseline**: Stable performance metrics established
4. **Quality Foundation**: Comprehensive test coverage and validation

## 📊 Current Status Summary

- **Completed**: 31/37 tasks (84%)
- **Remaining**: 6/37 tasks (16%)
- **Critical Path**: Security and Test Infrastructure
- **Estimated Completion**: 2 weeks with focused effort

**Recommendation**: Complete all 6 remaining Phase 1 tasks before advancing to Phase 2 to ensure proper system stabilization according to BMad methodology.
